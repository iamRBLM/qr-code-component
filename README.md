## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to write clean HTML and CSS code, using CSS utilities classes and CSS Variables (custom properties), for different styles, such as:

- Background color and Text color.
- Font sizes and Text styles.
- CSS Flexbox.

In this way the CSS elements are not fill with bunch of different CSS properties, and it puts everything in logical order.

Here are some examples from the code:

```html
<h1 class="text-lg text-dark-blue m-t-md m-b-sm">
  Improve your front-end skills by building projects
</h1>
```

```css
.text-lg {
  font-size: 1.46rem;
  line-height: 120%;
  font-weight: 700;
}

.text-dark-blue {
  color: var(--text-dark-blue);
}

.m-t-md {
  margin-top: 24px;
}

.m-b-sm {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will keep developing this technique of writing clean HTML and CSS - it makes it easy to read the code.
I will be focusing specifically on mastering CSS Flexbox and Grid techniques and responsive web design.
